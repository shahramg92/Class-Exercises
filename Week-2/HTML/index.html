    <h1>The Five Things I Am Most Passionate About</h1>
    <h2>Health And Fitness</h2>
    <p>I never used to love health and fitness, the second of my passions. At school I hated sport. I would hide in the toilets at try and avoid it.
      I walked the cross country, and school sports carnival was a nice day out in the grand stand with friends. After school finished I had a brief
      interlude with g-string leotards and the gym but it didn’t last long. Then something strange happened. I turned 24 or 25, my brain blew a fuse
      and all of a sudden I was joining a running group. Not only that, I was actually showing up. Me, who never ran unless I was late for the train.
      And I loved it. Who knew my legs could run!  My friends, thought I’d lost the plot. Not only did I start running, I joined a triathlon group and started
      training 10-14 times a week. Triathlon made me realize what being passionate about something meant. I just loved it. I ate, slept, woke, spoke
      and socialised triathlon. I talked to anyone who would listen about it, how great it was. I was passionate about how exercise made me feel.
      I was happier, lighter, healthier, and I had more energy. Then I became Robert de Castella, well not really but I actually had the skills,
      the drive and the motivation to compete.  I became passionate about setting goals, training and achieving them. I never thought I’d be good enough
      at sport to do that. And I competed a lot. Noosa, Mooloolaba, Gold Coast, Byron Bay, Raby Bay, Bulimba, the murky brown Brisbane River and Bondi Beach.
      I did fun runs, ocean swims, half marathons and 80klm bike rides. I felt ten foot tall and bullet proof. If I could register for a race I wanted to be
      part of it. If I could talk training plans with someone I did. Later, I became even more passionate about keeping fit when I realised it and yoga
      were a key part of managing, what was then, and every now and then still is, an over whelming sense of anxiety. Turns out flooding your body with endorphins
      is good for the psyche. What wasn’t good for the psyche was my growing waistline in life after triathlon. In between and after having two kids,
      plus living in some very social mining towns and the creeping onset of 40, I put on almost 10 kilos.  I realised I had to take action with what I ate.
      So I decreased what I ate/drank and increased the protein and unprocessed foods. It worked, I lost the weight. It’s easy to be passionate about health and
      fitness when that happens. The other thing that happens with this passion is you find a whole new tribe to hang out with and something to do in what
      can sometimes be quiet days, especially in a small mining town.  Mining towns often have child friendly group fitness classes. People chat, laugh and have
      a coffee after.  It’s a great way to meet new friends. So my chosen method of keeping fit often changes according to the seasons,enthusiasm, age and
      where I’m living (try running at 5.00am in a Mudgee winter!) but what won’t change is the agreement that I’ve made with myself to make exercise and good
      health a non-negotiable part of my life. I’m just too passionate about the benefits they bring. You look better, feel better, sleep better and you
      have more energy. But let’s not get too carried away. I’ll always negotiate some time to stop and enjoy some wine, chocolate, cake and exercise free days,
      after all I’m pretty passionate about them too. Let’s just hope I’m never passionate about g-string leotards again, that’s one thing the world can do without!
      What drives you to get your trainers on? or are you more motivated by the tv guide?

      Five reasons to be passionate about health and fitness:

      <ul>
        <li>You look better, feel better and sleep better.</li>
        <li>You have increased motivation to set and achieve goals</li>
        <li>Exercise and a good diet is a drug free way to help with anxiety</li>
        <li>Exercise is a great way to meet new friends and find your tribe</li>
        <li>Exercise gives you a guilt free way to enjoy the treats in life!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>I’m no postcard uni student. Studying is driving me crazy, nuts in fact. I’ll be 42 0r 43 before I finish and I think about quitting every day.
      I’ve been studying by distance on and off for the last seven and a half years.  I’m not sure my precious child free hours couldn’t be better spent and
      more enjoyed working and t think it’s fair to say that at times I really severely dislike it (read much stronger word here) but it hasn’t stopped me
      from being passionate about learning. I see the results of learning every day in my two terrors. The other day my almost two, Max said to me ‘Stop it Mum.’
      The week before that I found Max behind his door where he’d fallen asleep after climbing out of his cot.  Ruben can also get Max out of his cot, (there may
      or may not be a bit of a thud involved when he hits the floor), he can make his bed (with the smallest amount of protesting and little bit of help),
      buckle himself into his car seat and ride a two wheeler bike.  Why wouldn’t you be passionate about learning and self improvement when you see little
      things like that happening around you every day?  Seeing your kids grow and learn and become little people is something to be passionate about all on its own.  Then when you think of how we came to be adults and what we have learnt along the way the passion increases even more.
      For me I am passionate about learning  when I am passionate about learning and self development every time I open my blog and write another post and I think back to how I came to blog.  First reading about blogging in the Queensland Writers Centre monthly mag, then figuring out how to set up a blog, getting a logo, writing for my blog.  I get a kick out of using something that I built and mostly understand.  Then its pretty cool when you get other people who have learnt even more to make it even better. I am passionate about learning and self improvement when I feel the thrill of finally managing to get my feet off the floor in crow pose. Or when I take up a hem, or cook a new recipe.
      I am passionate about learning and self development when I get to do another course like how to write chick lit or writing for magazines and newspapers or Byron Yoga Teacher Training, or Blogging with Joanna Penn, or travel writing with Claire Scobie or Project management for writers.  I love it.  I love learning new stuff and knowing more today than I did yesterday and I love the like minded people you meet when you go to a course.
      I love following the media to learn about what’s going on in my community, the state, the country and the world around me.  I love learning about what my IBSD partner Susan K Mann is doing on the other side of the world in chilly Scotland.  Learning that people have the same problems, fears and worries as me and that they get by.
      I love to read a noticeboard and find out about the fete that’s coming up, the yoga classes that are on, fitness with Eager down at Thirroul Beach, the little kickers session at Austi, the Savvy Bulli Burn that’s coming up.  I think that it’s that feeling of connectedness that you get from know what’s going on around you.  It could also be just a little bit of not wanting to miss out on anything!
      I love to read a good self improvement book.  Mind mapping, How to speak so your kids will talk and listen so your kids will talk, 40 days of yoga, Story Engineering, Four Hour Work Week, On Writing.  It’s a great holiday when I get to read one cover to cover. And the information you can find now is not just on a noticeboard, in a book or in the media, now more than ever it’s online.
      We live in a changing world.  I’ve said it before, we are exposed to around 70 billions pieces of new content each day on Facebook alone.  Multiply that by the amount of blogs that you read, online newspapers, university research papers and we are looking at a phenomenal amount of information that we have access to right at the touch of a keyboard.  Information is now more accessible and and increasing in volume quicker than it ever has been before.  Mind you we can still make excuses not to learn. Sometimes it can feel like there’s lots of obstacles to learning like it’s too expensive, I can’t get to classes, I won’t understand, I’ll feel dumb, I’m too old, I don’t have time.  I’ve used all of those excuses and sometimes I still do but so far I’m still plugging away.
      I’m passionate about learning every time I pass another uni assignment or test from what feels like the never ending nine year degree. I study online by distance through University of Southern Queensland.  I deferred my Uni fees and somehow I manage to find the time and the motivation to keep studying and keep passing.   But there are some days when I think it’s not to strong a sentiment to say I really hate it.  I think what keeps me going is the sense of achievement will give me when or should I actually finish and the new things (even though sometimes they feel like useless things) I will have learnt.  And you don’t have to pay for a uni degree, there are a lot of free tertiary institution courses too.
      You can study free through some of the top universities in the world, Stanford and Harvard and right here in Oz Uni’s like Melbourne Uni offer plenty of free online courses.
      Not interested in Uni? Then there’s free courses on blogs.  How to manage your time, how to write a novel, how to fix your dishwasher.  The list is endless.
      If you think you’re not going to get it when you study or take a course don’t.  What’s the worst thing that can happen if you give it a go?  You fail, so what, try it again.
      When you try again and you master it, then you’ve got something to share with the community around you.  You can teach your kids soccer, teach a yoga class, get a new job, meet new people.
      While your learning you’re brain structure is changing becoming open to receiving even more information, then you can keep learning.
      Knowledge is power and we live in the age of knowledge.  The more I learn the more connected I feel to the world around me.
      You should try it, you’ll be surprised how good it makes you feel.

      Five reasons to be passionate about learning and self development:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning boosts your confidence and gives you a real feeling of achievement</li>
      <li>How cool is it too learn something today that you didn’t know yesterday</li>
      <li>The more you learn, the more you have to share, teach, help the community around you</li>
      <li>Learning changes the structure of your brain and make it more open to receiving even more information</li>
      <li>The more you learn, the more connected you can feel to the world around you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p> A few days back, I participated in a Presentation Skills workshop. As part of this workshop, I had to give a 4-minute presentation on any chosen topic from a list. I chose: I’m passionate about ____, and here’s why. Initially, I took some time trying to think what I was passionate about. The answer came to me in a few seconds(I hate the fact that it even took a few seconds). When I realized I was going to talk about music, I knew it wouldn’t be very difficult. After all, I love music! So I went back to the title so I could officially start working on the content, and that’s when it hit me. The title said “here’s why”. And I had no ready answer to that! This entry is going to be a bit of the self-exploration I went through as I tried to answer the question of why I believed music is my passion.

When you really like something, you often don’t give it a second thought. Without you realizing, it becomes a staple in your life – like food or water, and you can’t imagine its absence. It’s a part of you. That’s how music is to me.

I’ve been learning Indian Classical music(Carnatic) for around 10 years. I have also been a regular student at my school choir for all my school life. Initially I used to go to music classes because my parents asked me to. Also because I liked playing Badminton with my friends after class. So when academics got overwhelming, it wasn’t difficult for me to find an excuse to stop learning music. Despite this not-really-interested phase of learning music, thanks to good teachers and my in-built need to excel at what I do, I learnt quite a lot. Music was already becoming a part of my life. So when I stopped practicing music, there was a hole. That’s when the transition happened.  That’s when I knew I needed music in my life. From then on, I went back to music with an extra vigor. It showed in my progress. Music had moved on from being a small part of my life to a passion.

The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of why I’m passionate about music is: music is relaxing to me. It takes me to a whole new world where there are no worries or assignments or deadlines! It holds my attention and is probably the only thing I can concentrate on without getting distracted in 5 minutes. My mind doesn’t wander and this energizes me. It is refreshing and stimulating and I can go back to any other chore, inspired. The music I’m talking about here is of course not the background music we play while studying or driving but what I call “fore-ground music”; the one where you’re actively participating in singing or listening just for the sake of music in itself. This is the aspect of music which gives it a power of healing.

To me, music is more than just sound: it’s an art with rhythm, tune, emotion and meaning. In this sense, music can be inspiring and empowering. I believe music can be thought of as analogous to paint. You can splash paint around and have fun or create something valuable and complicated. But the best bet is to paint a beautiful picture and convey something. So too music can be fun, complicated or something meaningful and motivating. It can convey feelings of patriotism, sorrow, happiness, inspiration or spirituality that can stir up emotion and bring about change. This, I believe is the best form of music and the reason for its evolution over the ages as a means of communication.

Music is mathematics in its rhythm, logic in its composition, science in its octaves and pitches (In 600 BC, Pythagoras called music a science when he developed the Octave scale) and technology in its instruments and digitization. I think music is a field that deserves to be celebrated as much as engineering, medicine or law as it is just as much or probably even more powerful than any of these! I only wish I had realized this much when I was still trying to figure out my career many years back.

Music will always be one major part of my life, but I really hope I find the bridge to make it the most important.

    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <p>1. The Closer to Nature, the Healthier You’ll Be

Recent studies have shown that the closer you live to nature or green spaces in general (simple parks included), the happier you’ll be.

Being able to easily access the great outdoors gives you more opportunities to reap all the benefits that nature has to offer, especially more so than those who live in urban areas, who also happen to have worse mental and physical health than their more rural counterparts.

Coincidence? I think not.



2. Nature Changes Your Brain – For the Better

Just strolling around outside doesn’t really require any elaborate thinking or action or your part, which is great for your mind. When you take a walk in nature, electrochemical changes occur in your brain, producing calming and beneficial results.

Furthermore, the brain activity when entering a natural spot is indicative of a relaxed, meditate state. However, when leaving the spot, this activity is actually reversed, making being outside on a regular basis essential to good health.



3. Sunny Skies Give You Vitamin D…

Vitamin D is crucial to humans, helping to prevent disease and infection and improving bone health. Yet many people are lacking this essential vitamin, and there’s a simple way to get it – spending time out in the sun.

Sunrays provide plenty of vitamin D, so being outdoors during day can greatly improve your health.



4. …And a Good Night’s Sleep

While it may sound counterproductive, being out in the sun also helps you sleep.

Sunlight, especially in the morning, helps regulate your internal biological clock, making it much easier for you to get your needed rest when bed time rolls around.

5. The Outdoors Can Help You Kiss Your Stress Goodbye

Researchers are finding that being out in nature greatly reduces people’s stress levels. Simply taking in outdoor sights and sounds is relaxing to the body and mind, helping to decrease worry and anxiety.

You don’t have to be a nature lover either, or even enjoy being outdoors – it’ll still have stress reducing benefits, regardless of the time spent or type of activity you engage in.



6. Nature has Astounding Healing Properties

Nature has been shown to directly improve people’s physical health, including patients who are recovering from a disease or illness, surgery, or any other type of ailment.

Patients who are exposed to the outdoors tend to recover more quickly, use less pain medication, and have shorter hospital stays. And they don’t even have to physically be out in nature either; these remarkable results have also occurred from patients having a window with an outdoor view or paintings of nature in their room.

Now, how astounding is that?

7. Being Outside is Good for Your Mental Health

Nature can also help curb mental dieses as well, like depression, ADHD, and other psychiatric problems and illnesses. The relaxing and calming properties of nature greatly contribute to these results, and ADHD patients have also been shown to have longer attention spans when outdoors than inside.



8. More Outdoor Activity Makes for a Fitter, Healthier You

Being out in nature often involves some form of physical activity, whether it be strolling through the park, biking through the mountains, or an exciting river raft ride. This activity both improves physical fitness and can help decrease the likelihood of obesity.



9. Nature Heightens the Senses and Memory

Spending time outdoors doesn’t only work the physical aspects of your body but can also strengthen your senses and memory. When in nature, you’re exposed to plenty of sights, smells, sounds, and touches and have ample amounts of new things to take in.

These experiences help enhance all your senses, and being outdoors (even for short periods of time) has also been proven to improve short term memory.



10. Happiness – Pure and Simple

Let’s face it, being in nature just makes people happier in general. The great outdoors changes brain chemistry in a positive way, improves mood, decreases stress, provides opportunities for fun, and is simply downright beautiful.

All this ends up making for a happier and, thus, healthier you.

    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>I’m tired of people complaining that they’re tired. That they’re bored. That they hate what they do, and do what they hate, and live in this constant cycle of meh and blah and ugh.

Life is too short to wake up every morning and wish the day away. Life is too short to spend all week praying for the weekends, and then spend all weekend feeling purposeless and empty. Life is too short to focus so much time and attention on the negative—what we don’t have, what we don’t like, what we wish we could change.

Honestly, our time on earth is too precious to waste doing anything but soaking life in, celebrating every moment, and surrounding yourself with people who feel and do the same.

That’s why the only people I want to be around are the ones with a lust for life.

The ones who wakeup and decide to conquer every day. The ones who smile at the sunrise, who dance in their car at red lights, who sing in the long stretches of traffic.

I want to be around the ones who quit their dead-end jobs to follow their dreams, or pursue careers they love, or even in the monotony of their 9 to 5 workweek, find time for their passions.

I want to be around the people who love to hug, who love to kiss, who love to laugh and enjoy every second with the ones they care for.

I want to be around the people that don’t just give up, but pursue who and what they love relentlessly, who don’t just ho-hum along the beaten path, but wander and embrace every moment, good and bad, with open arms and a wide smile.

I want to be around the people who order too much food and tell crazy stories. The ones who are animated and loud, filled with a wild love for being human, and all of the roller-coaster ups and downs that come with.

I want to be around the people who climb mountains, who go for walks, who take pictures of anything and everything and hang the Polaroids on their walls. The ones who can’t wait to meet new people, try new things, experience the places and bodies outside their own.

I want to be around the people with a lust for life—who don’t sit stagnant and blah, but are hands up in the front row of the ride.
I want to surround myself with the people who smile, even after pain. The ones who forgive and step forward, who tell jokes with strangers, who go on adventures, who are always searching for ways to learn and grow and change.

I want to be around the people who love life, unapologetically. The ones who find light even in the worst circumstances and who spread that light with others.

I want to be around the people who watch sunsets, who hold hands, who write poetry and walk barefoot and ask people how they feel and really listen to the answer. The ones who find stories in the ocean, who find peace in the wind and the trees, who seek love in people and believe in it, no matter how many times their hearts have been broken.

I want to be around the people who, despite the wrong, the broken, the damaged, the hurt, can still find something beautiful in the world. And who wake up every day celebrating their discoveries.

I want to be around the people who love living, the ones who teach me how it feels to be alive.
