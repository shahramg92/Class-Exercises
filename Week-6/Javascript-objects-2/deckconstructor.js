// A deck is also represented as a collection of cards, but it would also be convenient for it to be able to shuffle itself, and be asked to draw a card. We would like to be able to do this with a Deck constructor:
//
// > var myDeck = new Deck()
// > myDeck.draw()
// Card {point: 6, suit: "clubs"}
// > myDeck.draw()
// Card {point: 1, suit: "spades"}
// > myDeck.shuffle()
// > myDeck.numCardsLeft()
// 50
// Implement a Deck constructor that will allow for the above code to work.
