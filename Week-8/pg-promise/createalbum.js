// Create album
//
// Write a script to create a new album in the database. You may either connect to your local database or your remote database. The script will prompt the user for an album name, a year, and an artist ID. You may use the prompt-promise module to get user prompts in the promise style - with this everything can be written in one straight chain. Be sure to sanitize your inputs!
//
// Example session:
//
// $ node create_album.js
// Album name? The Squeezed Apple
// Album year? 1998
// Artist ID? 4
// Created album with ID 2.
