Write a promise that adds two numbers and resolves the answer. However, if the two inputs provided are not both numbers reject the promise. The API should work like the following:

addNumbers(x, y)
  .then(function (answer) {
    console.log(answer);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
