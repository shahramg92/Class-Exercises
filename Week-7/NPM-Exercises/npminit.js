// Create a directory for today's work. Run npm init within it to create a package.json file within it. For the rest of these exercises, you will install modules using the --save option, so that the dependency will be remembered in your package.json file. After each time you install a module, check your package.json and see that what you installed has been added as a dependency.
//
// Create a .gitignore file, and within it, put node_modules, so that git will ignore the node_modules folder when you are adding files to be tracked.

Done
